# Cryptocurrency is all the rage. You have decided to create your own,
# KelloggCoin, that will massively disrupt financial markets at the Global
# Hub.

# Don't change the following code, which represents a series of transactions, each
# of which represents a transfer of KelloggCoin from one user to another â€“ transactions 
# with no from_user are from the "ICO" (Initial Coin Offering)

blockchain = [
  { "from_user" => nil, "to_user" => "ben", "amount" => 20000 },
  { "from_user" => nil, "to_user" => "brian", "amount" => 20000 },
  { "from_user" => "ben", "to_user" => "evan", "amount" => 9000 },
  { "from_user" => "brian", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 7000 },
  { "from_user" => "evan", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 400 },
  { "from_user" => "ben", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 1500 },
  { "from_user" => "anthony", "to_user" => "ben", "amount" => 4500 },
  { "from_user" => "anthony", "to_user" => "evan", "amount" => 1750 }
]

# Write code below that returns the number of KelloggCoin that each user has in their 
# KelloggCoin "wallet".

# It should print out:
# Ben's KelloggCoin balance is 14000
# Brian's KelloggCoin balance is 13000
# Evan's KelloggCoin balance is 10350
# Anthony's KelloggCoin balance is 2650

# ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ Your code HERE ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

# Start a hash to keep track of each user's balance
balances = Hash.new(0)

# Iterate through each transaction in the blockchain and update the balances accordingly
blockchain.each do |transaction|
  if transaction["from_user"].nil? # this is an ICO transaction
    balances[transaction["to_user"]] += transaction["amount"]
  else # this is a regular transaction
    balances[transaction["from_user"]] -= transaction["amount"]
    balances[transaction["to_user"]] += transaction["amount"]
  end
end

# Print out the balances
balances.each do |user, balance|
  puts "#{user.capitalize}'s KelloggCoin balance is #{balance}"
end
